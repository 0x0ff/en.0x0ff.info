**<span style="color:red">0x</span>0ff.info** is in english since very recenlty, to mark the occasion I chose to translate first the best articles of my french blog. Let's begin our journey with a somewhat thorny and terrifying subject, **[gdb]** debugger **101**!..
{: .text-justify}

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/comics_0x0ff/0x0ffinfo_comics_boom.png){: style="float: right; margin: 1em"}

However, let's not forget we are on a "*nasty little hacker websitees*" and not some devblog, this post will be carried out around a **[Buffer Overflow][refbo]** vulnerable program, a well-known system flaw, requiring tact and nimble fingers in order to exploit it.
{: .text-justify}

Building up skills in debugging, or even in the exploitation of the various buffer overflow vulnerabilities is no easy matter. And discovering this universe on your own will require you to arm yourself with a certain load of patience, courage, and anti-migraine pills (*not the blue ones*)... But don't worry, I walked past to somehow clear the way.
{: .text-justify}

This course will be presented as an articles series, yes, you heard that right, series. While writing this introduction, two other articles are in the proofreading phase, and few more are in the drafting phase. This spread will bring a pinch of explanation here, and a spoonful of details there and in short to overcome this little something that may have stuck those who have already failed in getting it working in the first place.
{: .text-justify}

Noob or insider, I hope you will be pleased by this insight...

# DEBUGGER Whatâ€™s what?
A debugger is a tool for debugging a program. This truism stated, here are some explanations. The ability to retrieve a certain amount of **[low level]** normally inaccessible information to the user (*systemwise*) during program execution is what a debugger makes possible, in other words, debbuging.. Many tools are available and allow you to debug a program: **ptrace**, **ltrace**, **dmesg**â€¦ But generally when we think debugger, **[Ollydbg]** or **[ida]** under **Windows**, and gdb under **Linux** are the most common answers youâ€™ll get.
{: .text-justify}

First of all, weâ€™ll only be interested in **gdb** which allows dynamically disassembling a program into [ELF (**E**xecutable and **L**inkable **F**ormat)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format). Disassembling is the **binary code** (_you know a bunch of zeros and ones_) translation in **assembly language instructions** (**asm**). The tool **gdb** like **Ollydbg** does this work on the fly while the program is running. Conversely, **Ida** makes it possible to disassemble the <u>program file</u> without the need of executing it, doing so by recognizing certain patterns (*groups of bytes*) and identifying them as corresponding to certain instructions somewhat readable (_but nothing alike an higher level programming language_).
{: .text-justify}

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts_img/gdb-example.png){: style="margin: 1em"}

Above the **gdb** command line interface with the great **peda** overlay. Reaching critical mass yet? Don't worry, youâ€™ll learn to love it, and after a while you might even cherish it, embrassing it like second nature. Remember that quote from **The Matrix** when Cypher watches the Matrix goes by while talking to Neo, and tell yourself it's the same:
{: .text-justify}

>_... there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead. Hey uh, you want a drink?_
{: .text-justify}

Like all debuggers, **gdb** allows you to do a certain number of operations on a program that weâ€™ll study in a while... To give you a quick overview of the possibilities that **gdb** offers, know that its main function is to provide a memory representation during program execution. Not very useful given the speed at which the execution of the said program takes place, you will say?
{: .text-justify}

Yes, but **gdb** also allows you to pause the running program! Widely known as **breakpoint** and amongst **gdb** possible operations this one will most-likely become your favourite. It is possible to define several breakpoints and to navigate between them. When the program is stopped at a breakpoint, a memory representation is displayed and other information is available through certain commands.
{: .text-justify}

It is also possible to execute the program instruction by instruction, also known as **step**. By instruction, I mean assembly language instruction (_see image above, the "-*--code---*" block_). As a reminder, the **ASM** language is the lowest level language still humanly readable before "**0** and **1**" made out of signalsâ€¦
{: .text-justify}

# MEMORY

Let's not get carried away, before getting to the core issue, it might be good to do a quick reminder on memory and processes. But don't worry I won't go into details, just give you a quick overview of how it all works, focusing on what is really relevant to exploiting **buffer overflow** with **gdb**.
When you run a program, your processor will perform a number of calculations corresponding to the different lines of code in that program. To perform these calculations quickly, it needs to store certain data where they will be very quickly accessible, two solutions are available to him:

- **Processor registers:** on **x86** we can quote **EAX**/**EBX**/**EIP**/**ESP**/**EBP**â€¦ In short, these are small memory spaces contained <u>inside the processor</u> and used for various things. _You will find the details of these registers in the Cheat Sheet below._
- **Random Access Memory:** Most of the information necessary for your programs execution is stored in your **RAM** modules: variables, pointers, stack, heap, etc...
{: .text-justify}

The memory space available in **RAM** is quite large. In order to quickly find the information bytes are numbered, these numbers are referred to as addresses. For example, at <span style="color:blue">0xbfffaabb</span> (_hexadecimal notation of the address_), weâ€™ll find the **Random Access Memory <span style="color:blue">3221203643</span>th byte**.
{: .text-justify}

![alt](/assets/images/posts_img/tipsico.png){: style="float: left; width: 60px; margin: 1em"}
**Small aside:** This is excactly why **64bit** systems allow you to add more **RAM** to your computer than **32bit** systems. Indeed **32** or **64** **bit** refers to <u>the length of the address bus</u> (_the part of a processor in charge of addressing_), a **32bit** system allows long addresses of **2^32 bits** or **4 bytes** (_from **0x0** to **0xffffffff**_) and therefore **4294967296** different addresses. The first part of these addresses is reserved for certain resources (_motherboard, graphics card, etc._) which leaves only around **3GB** of **RAM** available to the programs. Iâ€™ll let you follow this same logic to find the limit of a **64bit** system. ðŸ˜‹
{: .notice}
{: .text-justify}

If you refer to the infographic that I produced some time ago and which you can find below, you will notice that when a program is initialized, a certain number of the program-specific memory spaces are defined: **<span style="color:green">ext</span>**, **<span style="color:pink">GVar</span>**, **<span style="color:brown">BSS</span>**, **<span style="color:brown">Heap</span>**, **<span style="color:darkblue">Stack</span>**... For the moment we are going to focus exclusively on the **Stack** which is a memory space where **buffer overflows** are common.
{: .text-justify}

[![alt](/assets/images/posts_img/buffer-overflow-memory-segmentation-cheat-sheet.png){: style="float: center;"}](/assets/images/posts_img/buffer-overflow-memory-segmentation-cheat-sheet.png)

# STACK

You have to imagine the stack as a kind of notepad adapted to your machine. This memory space acts like a catch-all, and contains almost all the variables and pointers used by the various functions of your programs. Each function has its own stack portion called **stack frame**...

One of the stack peculiarities is that it grows towards low addresses. That is, by declaring successively two variables **<span style="color:blue">a</span>** and **<span style="color:red">b</span>**:
{: .text-justify}


```c
char a;
char b;
```

The variable **<span style="color:blue">a</span>** will have a bigger address than the variable **<span style="color:red">b</span>**. For example **<span style="color:blue">0xbfffa2</span>** for **<span style="color:blue">a</span>** and **<span style="color:red">0xbfffa1</span>** for **<span style="color:red">b</span>**â€¦ I know I know, it's not easy to understand but you will have to get used to it. Especially since it is not the hardest to assimilate...
{: .text-justify}

And yes, another cheerful memory feature in Linux is the **Little Endian** representation. As you probably know, the space taken by data in memory can vary (_if you ignored it I advise you to take a look at this paper: **[Dirty types of data!][refdirtydata]** not yet translated_). The **Little Endian** or **Big Endian** format influences how the data is ordered. Imagine a pointer pointing to a string. This pointer, like all pointers on a **32 bit** system is **4 bytes** long (_which is the size of an address, remember?_). Let's imagine that this pointer is located at the address **<span style="color:blue">0xbfff</span>** **<span style="color:green">aa00</span>** and contains the address of the first character of our string **<span style="color:blue">0xbfff</span><span style="color:orange">bbcc</span>**, this is how it would be represented based on [endianness].
{: .text-justify}

![alt](/assets/images/posts_img/little-big-endian.png){: style="float: center; width: 800px; margin: 1em"}

```
    Big Endian    |    Little Endian
----------------- | ----------------- 
0xBFFFAA00 : 0xBF | 0xBFFFAA00 : 0xCC 
0xBFFFAA01 : 0xFF | 0xBFFFAA01 : 0xBB
0xBFFFAA02 : 0xBB | 0xBFFFAA02 : 0xFF
0xBFFFAA03 : 0xCC | 0xBFFFAA03 : 0xBF
```

# SETTING UP

## PEDA INSTALLATION FOR GDB

Like any famous program, gdb brings together a community of creative people. And as so often this community is the source of great improvements. One of them is called **PEDA** for **P**ython **E**xploit **D**evelopment **A**ssistance for **GDB**: [https://github.com/longld/peda](https://github.com/longld/peda).
{: .text-justify}

This overlay colors up the information mass provided by gdb, which is not a luxury touch! Here's how to install it:
{: .text-justify}

```shell
git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit
echo "DONE! debug your program with gdb and enjoy"
```

## WRITE A PROGRAM VULNERABLE TO BUFFER-OVERFLOW

First step for our **gdb** study, write a program vulnerable to **[Buffer Overflow][refbo]** because we are supposedly on an **InfoSec Blog**, for god's sake!
{: .text-justify}

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
 
void funcMyLife();
 
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 printf("[0] main() Start here.\n");
 if(argc != 2)
 {
 printf("[X] Usage : %s <message>\n", argv[0]);
 exit(0);
 }
 printf("[1] Calling funcMyLife().\n");
 funcMyLife(argv[1]);
 printf("[6] main() end at the next instruction. \n");
 return 0;
}
 
void funcMyLife(const char *arg)
{
 printf("[2] funcMyLife() Start here.\n");
 printf("[3] Variable buffer declaration.\n");
 char buffer[128];
 printf("[4] Calling strcpy(). <= [Vulnerability]\n");
 strcpy(buffer, arg);
 printf("\nMessage : %s\n\n", buffer);
 printf("[5] funcMyLife() end at the next instruction (ret).\n");
```

## COMPILE OUR PROGRAM WHILE LIMITING THE PROTECTIONS

Unfortunately for you young hackers, **IT** evolved and continues to evolve rather quickly, and over the years many security features have been developed in order to make the exploitation of these vulnerabilities a real ordeal:
{: .text-justify}

- **ASLR** protection (_**A**ddress **S**pace **L**ayout **R**andomization_) helps make the random process anatomy. At each new execution, the stored data is placed in different memory spaces.
- **SSP** protection (_**S**tack-**S**mashing **P**rotector_) intercalates memory spaces between the useful data of the stack. The integrity of these spaces is checked. Any modification of these "**Canaries**" causes an immediate program interruption.
- No possible Stack or Heap execution, these memory spaces are intended to only contain variables and pointers but in no case executable code.
{: .text-justify}

In order to simplify this introduction as much as possible, we are going to deactivate all these protections. We will also force the compilation to **32 bit** (_for those who use a **64 bit** system_):
{: .text-justify}

```shell
 #Cette Ã©tape peut s'avÃ©rer nÃ©cessaire si votre systÃ¨me est en 64bit et que vous ne disposez pas des librairies permettant de compiler en 32bit
apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
# DÃ©sactiver l'ASLR
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# Compilation 32bit, stack exÃ©cutable, pas de stack protector
gcc -m32 -g -z execstack -fno-stack-protector ./bfpoc.c -o bfpoc
# This step may be necessary if your system is in 64bit and you do not have the libraries allowing to compile in 32bit 
apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 # Disable ASLR 
echo 0> / proc / sys / kernel / randomize_va_space # 32bit compilation, executable stack, no stack protector 
gcc -m32 -g -z execstack -fno-stack-protector ./bfpoc.c -o bfpoc
```

## HIGHLIGHTING THE BUFFER OVERFLOW

Now that we have made our vulnerable binary, we next have to highlight the **[Buffer Overflow][refbo]**. If you have made the effort to read the code, you should now know that the program takes the character string passed in parameter and copies into the **buffer[<span style="color:purple">128</span>]** variable a memory space which can theoretically contain **<span style="color:orange">127</span>** characters as well as the character end of string **<span style="color:red">0x00</span>**.
{: .text-justify}

But let's see first of all how this program behaves outside **gdb** and without any debugging toolâ€¦ Because yes, carefully studying the behavior of a program saves time, it is therefore a reflex to integrate from now on.
{: .text-justify}


## NORMAL RUNNING

```shell
./bfpoc aaa
[0] main() Start here.
[1] Calling funcMyLife().
[2] funcMyLife() Start here.
[3] Variable buffer declaration.
[4] Calling strcpy(). <= [Vulnerability]

Message : aaa

[5] funcMyLife() end at the next instruction (ret).
[6] main() end at the next instruction.
```

## 1 BYTE MEMORY OVERFLOW

```shell
./bfpoc $(python -c 'print "a"*128')
[0] main() Start here.
[1] Calling funcMyLife().
[2] funcMyLife() Start here.
[3] Variable buffer declaration.
[4] Calling strcpy(). <= [Vulnerability]

Message : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[5] funcMyLife() end at the next instruction (ret).
[6] main() end at the next instruction.
```

Indeed, the data located just after the space reserved for the variable **buffer[<span style="color:purple">128</span>]** may have already been used, nor been essential, or perhaps the overwritten byte already contained the value **<span style="color:orange">0x00</span>**. Without forgetting the concept of memory alignment which can cause unused memory gaps (_See the paragraph Memory alignment of the article [Dirty types of data!][refdirtydata]_)...
{: .text-justify}

By passing a **128** character string as a parameter, **129** characters are copied into the **buffer[<span style="color:purple">128</span>]** variable because of the automatically added string character **<span style="color:orange">0x00</span>** end. However this memory overrun does not generate an error... weird hey? Not necessarilyâ€¦ But we'll this this another time.
{: .text-justify}

## SEGMENTATION FAULT #1

```shell
./bfpoc $(python -c 'print "a"*136')
[0] main() Start here.
[1] Calling funcMyLife().
[2] funcMyLife() Start here.
[3] Variable buffer declaration.
[4] Calling strcpy(). <= [Vulnerability]

Message : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[5] funcMyLife() end at the next instruction (ret).
[6] main() end at the next instruction.
Erreur de segmentation
```

By increasing the character count in our string passed as an argument, we end up getting what we are looking for: a significant **<span style="color:red">Segmentation Fault</span>** error in the **[Buffer Overflow][refbo]**. However, it is not the one we are looking for because the error only occurs when exiting the main function â€¦
{: .text-justify}

## SEGMENTATION FAULT #2

```shell
./bfpoc $(python -c 'print "a"*140')
[0] main() Start here.
[1] Calling funcMyLife().
[2] funcMyLife() Start here.
[3] Variable buffer declaration.
[4] Calling strcpy(). <= [Vulnerability]

Message : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[5] funcMyLife() end at the next instruction (ret).
Erreur de segmentation
```

You just have to push the plug a little further to finally find what you are looking for, a segmentation error preventing you from exiting the **funcMyLife()** function. This is very interesting for us, because it means that the **<span style="color:red">Return Address</span>** of the function has been overwritten by what we entered.
The Return Address is a pointer which is positioned at the start of the stack, when entering the function, and whose mission is to save the next instruction location to be executed when exiting the function.
{: .text-justify}

## CONCLUSION OF PART 1

And There you go ! This first part ends here and I feel like you might be bubbling "*Pfff! We haven't even started gdb, what a scam!*". Yes, true, but admit that it was not so uninteresting after allâ€¦ What is certain is that it was important to see or review the basics before onboarding on the Debuggers, **[Buffer Overflow][refbo]** adventure, all of those are relatively sophisticated subjects and it is essential to know exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it. Consider that the foundation has just been laid. We will tackle the structural work in **part 2**, and I promise you from now on, we will use **gdb**.

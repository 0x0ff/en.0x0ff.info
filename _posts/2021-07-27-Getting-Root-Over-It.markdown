I started working on a little side project few months ago. It began with me fumbling around **Unity** to learn it. At some point I told myself "_Hey, it would be fun to make some **CTF challenges** around it!_". So here we are now!

After starting this little thing, I've found out that purposly hackable games is already something. Notably there is **[Pwn Adventure][pwn_adventure]** a quite constential game. The **2020 GoogleCTF** was also built around a game (_[there a cool interview of **BitK** by **Nahamsec** about this event][yt_bitk_nahamsec]_). I'm no **Google** nor somewhate good in dev or in InfoSec... But hey, It's something, right? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Game Overview

"**Getting Root Over It!**" is a "**Rage Game**" much like "**Getting Over it**" or "**Boxman Struggle**" (_but shittier_) currently under development but already playable! The gameplay is focused around time score, so it's clearly designed to speedrun it!

[There a short (_low quality_) gameplay video][groi_gameplay_preview], and [here a full run video (_version v0.0.2_)][groi_first_run] and bellow some pictures of this early early version!

# Download the game

### v0.0.2

This early version is more of a demo. But ! It's definitly playable!
{: .text-justify}

To download the first version of the game, you need to create an account on [root-me.org][root-me_org] and start the virtual environment named "**getting-root-over-it-v1**". And then... You kinda have to break into it before playing it! Sorry about that.

### v0.0.3

Soon...
{: .text-justify}

This version will have an option to disable the "challenge" part of the game, allowing to play it without hacking it first! It will be downloadable here also. :)
